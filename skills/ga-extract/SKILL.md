Extract health records from a local PDF or image into GA through the `ga-server` MCP tools. GA never sends data anywhere: you read the file yourself.

1. Read the PDF or image locally (the path must exist on this machine).
2. Emit one `Observation` per result:
   - `code.coding` with a LOINC code (`system: http://loinc.org`) only when confident, otherwise `code.text` only.
   - `valueQuantity` with a UCUM unit (`system: http://unitsofmeasure.org`, `code`).
   - `effectiveDateTime` = specimen collection date (`YYYY-MM-DD`), not the report date.
   - `referenceRange` when printed; `status: final`.
3. Emit `Condition` and `MedicationStatement` resources only when the document explicitly states them.
4. Never invent values, units, dates or codes. Omit what the document does not say.
5. Do not set `subject`, `derivedFrom` or identifiers; GA sets them.
6. Call `ga_import` once per document: `{resources: [...], sourceFile: "<absolute path>", documentDate: "<report date YYYY-MM-DD, optional>"}`. It returns an import report (created/skipped/merged/conflicts/invalid). Re-importing the same document is safe.
7. Read data with `fhir_search` and `fhir_read`.
